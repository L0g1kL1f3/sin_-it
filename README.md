This is a game of sink the fleet made by me "JONI" for the Bridge data Science boot camp, with no for or while loops this code uses recurcive and mapping for all
needed calculations, from the random placement of the boat to the calculation for the computer player to predict where he should atack. it was a real pain to do
and if you are incline to read this beware it is a lot.:)



Would like to take this oportunaty to thank, my teacher Alberto Romero and his teacher assistences Carmelo Gragera, Julia Martinez Tapia and Jhon Moncaleano. 
Thank you for your pacience, to deal with someone like me I am sure you are not paid well enough... yet some how you still manage to help me and give me feedback.

Thank you.




Thanks for IllOmenX he was the first to publish the work giving the rest of us a lot of time to read his code and improve apon it, like newton said
"I am tall because I stand on the shoulder of giants" 

THANK YOU IllOmenX


And finally thanks to Alvaro-Maldo for his pacience listing to my madness.THANK YOU
