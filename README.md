# sin_-it

This is a game of sink the fleet made by me "JONI" for the Bridge data Science boot camp, with no for or while loops this code uses recurcive and mapping for all needed calculations, from the random placement of the boat to the calculation for the computer player to predict where he should atack. it was a real pain to do and if you are inclined to read this beware it is a lot.:)

Would like to take this opportunity to thank, my teacher Alberto Romero and his teacher assistants Carmelo Gragera, Julia Martinez Tapia and Jhon Moncaleano. Thank you for your patience, to deal with someone like me I am sure you are not paid well enough... yet some how you still manage to help me and give me feedback.

Thank you.

Thanks to IllOmenX he was the first to publish the work giving the rest of us a lot of time to read his code and improve on it, like newton said "I am tall because I stand on the shoulder of giants"

And finally thanks to Alvaro-Maldo for his patience in listing to my madness.THANK YOU
